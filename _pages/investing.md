## How Does It Work

![full](/assets/images/structure.png)

## Key Risks

Investments in the Fund are subject to varying degrees of risks.  Some of the key risks of investing are set out below:
- **investment risk** - distributions may or may not be paid and capital may or may not be returned;
- **default and credit risk** - a borrower under a Loan may not be able to pay principal and interest payments due under the Loan;
- **priority risk** - the Fund may invest in Loans which are subordinated to senior lenders.  The Fund will only be capable of distributing capital and income payments in respect of a Loan once the senior lenders have been repaid; and
- **security enforcement risks** - the Loans may be secured by a first ranking or second ranking mortgage over real estate and other forms of security.  There is a risk that the sale of the security would not be sufficient to cover capital and income repayment obligations to investors or that the sale of the security would take a significant amount of time.
