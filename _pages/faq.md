## Do you hold an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL)?

Yes. Managed investment schemes can be either registered or unregistered. In both cases, the operator must hold an Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence authorising it to run the scheme. Atlas Capital Management is the corporate authorised representative of AFSL 407100 which was issued by the ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission). Of course, holding an AFSL is only the basic requirement of running an investment business/dealing in financial product, the integrity, investment experience and operational expertise of the investment manager is a more important measure in ensuring meeting investors’ objectives, over both longer and short term.

## What are the major features of the Atlas Capital Property Credit Income Fund? Can investors see the size of the total fund and the specific investment projects? If the Fund is not fully invested, will the fixed income return on investment is affected?

The investment objective of the Atlas Fund is to provide stable and attractive income returns to investors in a highly secured manner. The investment offering enables investors to participate in a secured fashion in investment opportunities in Australian real estate projects, such as land development, large-scale commercial, and residential development.

The Investment Funds offered by Atlas Capital Management is mortgage-backed debt investment. The fund provides financing to land and real estate developers by means of loans. The investment risk is controlled by the Atlas Investment Team's in-depth understanding of the borrowing project as well as physically secured against the assets (i.e. first ranking mortgages) for which the loan is lend to, furthermore, extra security is required by way of the borrowers’ personal guarantee and Corporate guarantees, i.e. General Security Agreement (GSA).

Atlas’ Credit Income Fund is typically structured as SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) which means each loan is lent to one specific property development project.

The advantage of this fund structure is that it allows effective risk control, and the underlying asset for which the Fund owns the collateral is very clear and transparent. This makes o it is easier to assess the security level of the loan.

In contrast, pooled investment funds are less transparent, because there are many specific assets in the pool, and it is difficult to assess the overall investment risk. Of course, the theoretical benefit of pool funds is that risk can be diversified, and liquidity is generally higher, investors can subscribe or withdraw more frequently.

Given the above-mentioned, each SPV of the Atlas Fund has different scales, from a few million to over 50 million, however the way each SPV operates is roughly the same. The benefit of such fund structure means that there is certainty in terms of the income return because there will be no idle investment. Whilst in a pool fund, capital may not be fully invested which could lead to uncertainty in its income return.

## What function does the Trustee company perform? How the investors' funds are monitored and protected from fraud and un-authorised transactions?

A trustee is a person or firm that holds and administers property or assets for the benefit of a third party.

In terms of the Atlas Funds, the professional third-party trustee we work with is there to protect the interests of the beneficiaries of the Fund, i.e. the investors. The trustee conducts all transactions in the trust in his own name and must sign all documents on behalf of the trust. The primary responsibility of the trustee is to comply with the terms of the trust deed and act in the best interests of the beneficiary.

The trustee company for the Atlas Capital Property Credit Income Fund is the Melbourne based SILC GROUP which provide oversight to over 50 fund managers. SILC’s responsibilities as the Fund’s Trustee include reviewing and approval of the Fund’s lending programs and ensures that investment selection and lending process is adhered as prescribed in the Information Memorandum, such as whether the total borrowing is lower than the prescribed maximum LVR, whether the borrowing company provides the personal and corporate liability guarantee, and the credibility of the valuation company, etc. The operation of the fund is compliance reviewed regularly to ensure that it operates in accordance with the information memorandum.

The SILC Group also acts as the administrator for the Fund which is responsible for registering unit holder interest and processing all the transactions for the Fund.

As mentioned, the Atlas Funds are structured as SPVs (SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLE). The loan collaterals are only registered under the name of the Fund. If the property development company goes bankrupt, the asset for which the Fund hold as collateral will be independently cleared, and the principal will be repaid to the investor after the mortgaged property auction.

When the fund is established, the investment management company is required to meet the qualifications and have enough working capital. The investment management company are also required to hold professional indemnity insurance.

Therefore, under the regulatory framework described above, especially under the arrangement where there is separation of investment, trustee and administration functions, the possibility of fraud and unauthorised transactions is almost non-existent.

## What return can investor expect from the Atlas Capital Property Credit Income Fund?

For the expected return, investors should pay attention to if it is annualized or for the whole term of the investment, and whether it is gross return i.e. before fees or net income i.e. after fees.

In the current market condition, the Atlas Fund provides an annualised net return of 8.0%.

## What is the risk of the Atlas Property Credit Income Fund? Is this investment secure? Is there any risk in my principal? How do you control the risks in the development loan? What if the developer does not pay interest and principal?

The major risk of any fixed-income Fund is the risk of capital loss, i.e. the borrower failed to return the principal to investors.

At Atlas, we have a rigorous process to assess and minimize the risk. As a prudent investor, Atlas Capital Management take extra measures to understand the risk involved with the borrowing entity and the loan terms are legally constructed to maximise investor protection.

The risk level varies depending on the type and stage of the development project. However, a sound investment project is naturally able to pass all our tests, that is, the developer has in-depth property development experiences, well capitalised and have strong cash flow disciplines; the asset value is accurate with regards to the prevailing market condition, and the value of the asset is expected to be further increased; the interest on the loan is preferably prepaid; and the project can be successfully completed.

In terms of the Fund’s collaterals, without exception, the Atlas Fund requires first ranking mortgage to be registered under the Fund’s name in order to making the loan investment. LVR (Loan to Value ratio = loan amount / market value of mortgage assets) is the basic indicator for analysing the security associated with mortgage-backed debt investment. The lower the LVR, the higher the security of borrower's capital. In our case, our maximum LVR is 70%.

When a property project is completed and delivered, the project begins to pay off debts and pay dividends. In terms of fulfilling its debt obligations, the following order applies: first-ranking mortgage holder > secondary mortgage holder > preferred stock > common stock, i.e. Ordinary Shares. Debt investors of first ranking collateral are the most secure investors, precisely because such investors have the first right to compensation for the land and projects.

There are three types of mortgage guarantees required by Atlas. In the current market situation, the Atlas Fund only lend to borrowers which can provide first ranking collateral. In addition, Atlas also requires property developers to provide individual as well as corporate liability guarantees. In the unlikely event of the liquidation value of the project asset is not enough to repay the investor's principal, the personal and company assets of the responsible person of the borrowing company will also be held responsible for any outstanding debt payments. 

## How long does my money need to be in the Fund? If I want to use the money, can I withdraw from the Fund?

Investors should have a reasonable understanding of risks and return. For real estate debt investments, while there is a robust mechanism to protect investors, by way of a multiple level of collaterals. On the other hand, the relatively higher return delivered to investors is partly due to the sacrifice of liquidity. Bank deposit, while highly liquid, lacks attractive interest rate.

The Atlas Funds are generally loan investments for single property development projects. The loan term is generally within 1-2 years. Investing in such funds will typically have minimum capital lock-up period, that is, investors cannot transfer funds within a certain period of time. After the lock-up period, investors will have the opportunity to redeem their principal based on the liquidity of the Fund.

## Will the Fund charge management fees?

Most Fund charges management fee. However, for investors, what matters is the net income return being delivered which the management fee has already been accounted for.

## Is there a minimum amount required to be an investor in the Fund? 

The Atlas Funds are designed for qualified wholesale investors. Section 761G (7) of the Corporations Act defines wholesale investor as:
  - A person or entity that has obtained an accountant’s certificate within the preceding six months stating that the client:
    - (a) has net assets of at least $2.5 million, or
    - (b)  has a gross income for each of the last two financial years of at least $250,000;
  - A person or entity that is controlled by a person or entity that meets the requirements of (a) or (b) above;
  - A person or entity who invests at least $500,000 into the Financial Product.
An SMSF can also be classified as wholesale if the trustee of an existing superannuation fund meets the wholesale investor general test mentioned above.
