## What are the risks of the Atlas Capital Property Credit Income Fund?
The major risk of investing in the Fund are as follows: 
- default and credit risk - a borrower under a Loan may not be able to pay principal and interest payments due under the Loan;
- security enforcement risks - even the Loans may be secured by a first ranking registered mortgage over real estate and other forms of security, there is still a risk that the sale of the security would not be sufficient to cover capital and income repayment obligations to investors or that the sale of the security would take a significant amount of time. 
Atlas Capital seeks to use its best endeavours to mitigate the repayment default risk with respect to the Loans provided by the Fund by：
- assessing creditworthiness of the borrowers and the terms of the loans in accordance with its lending strategy which includes a loan-to-value (LVR) requirement and the in-depth understanding of the development projects to be carried out by the borrowers; 
- ensuring that first mortgages are registered over the development 
- ensuring that the general security agreement granted over all assets and undertakings of the borrower is provided. 
The risk level varies depending on the type and stage of the development project. However, a sound development project of which the developer has in-depth property development experiences, is well capitalised, has strong cash flow disciplines, has accurate asset value in light of the prevailing market condition with a potential of growth or development would usually pass our tests.   
Please refer to the IM for further information on the risks associated with investing in the Fund.
